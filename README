The OSGi-Inspector project

Goals: 

- offer convenient methods to analyze internals of the OSGi runtime like:
	- unsatisfied and pending service requests
	- mismatching version constraints on packages
	- memory consumption on bundle level
	- capabilities of the OSGi runtime (which core services in what version)
- statistics about used frameworks and packages
- runtime bundle wiring (on package level)
- lifecycle information (when did the framework really start)
- http service to provide a convenient UI
- console extension to use the command line (unfortunately this is implementation dependent)
- plug-able reasoner to help analyze errors/problems

Internal Requirements:
- OSGi R4 runtime (best results with R4.2)
- no other dependencies on 3rd party libraries or special OSGi framework implementations
- started before any other bundle in order to track service service requests

Features since 0.1.0:
- discovery of unsatisfied service requests
- tracking of pending service requests
