Must-Have features:

OK - reveal not satisfied service look-ups 
OK - pending service listeners
- potential Version conflicts 
	* multiple packages imported in different (not overlapping) Versions
	* Versions with qualifiers and without them (String compare problem)
- update TrackedBundleImpl if the bundle gets updated/uninstalled
- check for DynamicImport statements and track them.
- check for require Bundle
- Error track for spring bundles not starting 
	-> hint what might have caused it! 
	--> create a reasoner bundle to do the analysis!
- domain LifeCycle feature (also separate bundle)
- analyze why a bundle didn't resolve/ or start

Nice to have:
- What packages are actually in the OSGi container?
- What is the actual wiring of bundles/packages - where do I depend on during runtime?
- What services does the container offer (in which versions)?
- Capabilities of the OSGi container

Way later...

Versioning tutorial:
- have two OSGi containers
- one does the scripting and provides the web based UI (open a browser after start)
- one does the actual testing
- remote control with cxf and remote services
- back channel with events and AJAX to print out what happens
