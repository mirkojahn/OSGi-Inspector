The source code of this bundle is licensed under two different licenses, because the used JavaScript library
does not provide the ASL license. For that reason, the files coming from JQuery are licensed and MIT. 
Everything else is licensed under the ASL 2.0. 

NOTE: JQuery is also licensed und GPL (dual licensed), but because I don't like the terms of the GPL, 
especially with regard to company usage, I decided to stick to the less restrictive MIT license that in
fact is compatible with the ASL 2.0. I am not a lawyer, so don't take my word for it and check for yourself.

However, to use the inspector API, you're not required to use this bundle. If you're in doubt, just stick to
the plain API's, get inspired by this bundle to see what you could do and use your imagination as the only 
limit ;-)
